MAKE SURE IN CONFIGURATION YOU ARE USING LINUX BASED CONTAINERS NOT WINDOWS BASED CONTAINERS



Clone the repository by running Git in a container.
---------------------------------------------------
$   docker run --name repo alpine/git clone https://github.com/docker/getting-started.git
$   docker cp repo:/git/getting-started/ .


Build the image: A Docker image is a private file system just for your container. It provides all the files and code your container needs.
---------------
$   cd getting-started
$   docker build -t docker101tutorial .


Run your first container: Start a container based on the image you built in the previous step. Running a container launches your application with private resources, securely isolated from the rest of your machine.
-------------------------
$   docker run -d -p 80:80 --name docker-tutorial docker101tutorial


Now save and share your image: Save and share your image on Docker Hub to enable other users to easily download and run the image on any destination machine.
------------------------------
$   docker tag docker101tutorial bridgetmelvin/docker101tutorial
$   docker push bridgetmelvin/docker101tutorial
